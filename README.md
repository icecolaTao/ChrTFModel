# ChrTFModel

This repository contains resources for simulating polymer-based chromatin models with varying enhancer-promoter linear distances and degrees of TF phase separation, using Gromacs (version 4.5.7) with the Plumed plugin (version 2.5.0).

It includes the following components:

**Simulation Files:** Input files for setting up and running the chromatin model simulations.

**Analysis Tools:** Python scripts for downstream analysis of simulation output files, including contact probability and TF clustering measurements.
